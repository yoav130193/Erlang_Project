<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Our project offfers an different interpetation of the R.P.L Â communication protocol, the main difference is that in normal R.P.L circumstances, all nodes are static whilst in our simulator, noded move around a 1000X1000 grid. Our project offers some:
* Distributed BFS
* Shortest Path Between Two Vertices (Bellman Ford)
* communication between many different and independent modules
* video of a sample of running the project can be found here: https://youtu.be/teE5jcW7z0M


### Built With
* [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) - version 23


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
The git offers 2 impelemtations of the design, one done locally (on 4 terminals) and the other in a distributed fashion. 
before getting started, you must choose which one you want to run, and then continue.
open 4 terminals and create 4 4 erlang nodes with the names m_node,g_node,r_node,n_node, once you've done that,
Open folder and terminal for the 'master' node, open a folder and terminal for each one of the submasters.
in each terimnal write:
```sh
git clone hhttps://github.com/yoav130193/Erlang_Project.git
cd Erlang_Project
```

<h3>m_node</h3>
```sh
erl
```
compile 'app_test','script':
```sh
c(app_test).
c(script).
app_test:startRun()
```

<h3>r_node or g_node or n_node</h3>
```sh
erl
```
compile ,'script':
```sh
c(script).
script:compileAll().
wrapper:start_link.
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
<br />

* Choose whether you want the R.P.L server to work in storing or non-stroring mode, once you have chosen either of them, press the "start" button on the GUI.
* start spawning Nodes/roots.
* choose a source node for sending a message
* choose Destination nodes, however many as you want.
* write in the text box the message to send.
* press send message once ready, if the message can be sent, a brief route of the message will be drawn on the GUI.
